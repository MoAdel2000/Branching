The 'git branch' command is used to manage branches in your Git repository. 
It allows you to:

------------------------
# List branches:

- ' git branch ' : Lists all local branches, indicating the currently checked out branch with an asterisk (*).
- ' git branch -a ' : Lists all branches, including local and remote branches.

------------------------
# Create a new branch:

- git branch <branch_name>: Creates a new branch named <branch_name> from the current HEAD commit.
- git branch <branch_name> <start_point>: Creates a new branch named <branch_name> starting from the commit <start_point>.

------------------------
# Switch to a different branch:

- git checkout <branch_name>: Switches to the branch named <branch_name>.

------------------------
# Delete a branch:

- git branch -d <branch_name>: Deletes the branch named <branch_name>, but only if it is merged into the current branch.
- git branch -D <branch_name>: Forces the deletion of the branch named <branch_name>, even if it is not merged.
