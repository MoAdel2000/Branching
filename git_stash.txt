--------------------
The ' git stash ' command is a powerful tool in Git for temporarily shelving your uncommitted changes and returning to a clean working directory. 

----------------------------------
# What it does:

Stores the current state of your working directory (both tracked and staged changes) in a "stash" stack.
Reverts your working directory to its state before the stash, leaving you with a clean workspace.


----------------------------------
# Common usage:

- Basic stash: git stash: Saves your changes and restores the working directory.
- Stash with message: git stash -m "<message>": Saves changes with a descriptive message for easier identification.
- Listing stashes: ' git stash list ' : Shows a list of your stashes with information like commit hashes and messages.
- Applying a stash: ' git stash apply <stash_id> ' : Reintegrates the specified stash back into your working directory.
- Dropping a stash: ' git stash drop <stash_id> ' : Permanently removes the specified stash from the stack.

----------------------------------
# Additional options:

- Keeping untracked files: git stash -u: Includes untracked files in the stash.
- Stashing specific files: git stash -p: Lets you choose which files to stash.
- Applying with conflicts: git stash apply -f: Forces application even if conflicts arise.
